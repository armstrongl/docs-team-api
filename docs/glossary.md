# Glossary

A shared glossary establishes consistent terminology across documentation, product, and engineering teams. This guide explains what a glossary is, why docs teams need one, and how to create your own.

## What is a shared glossary

A shared glossary is a documented set of term definitions that teams reference when discussing feature launches, project planning, and cross-functional collaboration. It transforms implicit assumptions into explicit agreements about what words mean in your organization's context.

The glossary serves as a reference that all teams—documentation, product, engineering, and marketing—can consult when they need clarification about process terminology. It does not define product-specific terminology (that belongs in user-facing documentation) but rather the internal language teams use to coordinate work.

## Why docs teams need a glossary

Cross-functional collaboration breaks down when teams use the same words to mean different things. Common sources of confusion include:

**Ambiguous stage terminology:** Does "release" mean code is deployed or that users can access it? Does "launch" include the announcement or just the availability? Different teams often have conflicting interpretations.

**Unclear ownership boundaries:** Who is responsible for the "estimated launch date"—product or engineering? If teams have different assumptions, planning suffers.

**Implicit timing assumptions:** What does "code complete" mean for documentation planning? Without a shared definition, docs teams may start work too early or too late.

**Variable process terms:** Is the planning artifact called a "launch doc," "project brief," or "PRD"? Inconsistent naming creates friction when setting up templates and processes.

A glossary prevents these problems by establishing authoritative definitions that teams can reference when disputes arise. It makes invisible collaboration patterns visible and reduces the overhead of repeatedly clarifying basic terms.

## Core components

An effective glossary includes several types of definitions that address different collaboration challenges.

### Stage and milestone terms

Define what each phase of your feature development process means and what signals the transition between phases. This includes terms like:

- Development milestones (code complete, feature complete, ready for review)
- Release stages (alpha, beta, early access, general availability)
- Launch activities (announcement, rollout, deprecation)

For each stage, specify what triggers entry into that stage and what documentation activities should occur during or after it. This helps docs teams understand when to start work and when to expect information from other teams.

### Artifact and deliverable terms

Define the documents, work items, and outputs that teams create during the launch process. This includes:

- Planning documents (project documents, design docs, technical specs)
- Work tracking items (epics, tickets, projects)
- Documentation deliverables (docs plans, content, reviews)

Specify which team owns each artifact and what sections or fields are required. This clarifies handoff points and ensures teams know what to expect from each other.

### Role and responsibility terms

Define who does what by establishing clear terminology for expertise and ownership. This includes:

- Subject matter experts and reviewers
- Decision-makers for different aspects of launches
- Teams responsible for specific deliverables

Specify what responsibilities come with each role. This prevents assumptions about who should provide information or approve decisions.

### Process and mechanism terms

Define how your teams coordinate work through meetings, systems, and workflows. This includes:

- Regular synchronization meetings
- Technical mechanisms (feature flags, rollout controls)
- Workflow states and transitions

Specify what happens during each process step and what triggers transitions. This makes collaboration patterns explicit and repeatable.

## Creating your own glossary

Start by identifying terms that cause confusion in your current workflow. Look for:

- Words that mean different things to different teams
- Concepts that require repeated explanation in meetings
- Terms that appear in your templates and processes
- Handoff points where miscommunication occurs frequently

For each term, write a definition that includes:

1. **What it means:** A clear, concise explanation of the concept
2. **When it applies:** Conditions or triggers that signal this state or activity
3. **Who is responsible:** Which role or team owns this aspect
4. **What happens next:** How this relates to other process steps

Keep definitions focused on your team's specific usage. A term like "code complete" might mean something different in your organization than in another, and that is acceptable. The goal is consistency within your team, not universal applicability.

Involve stakeholders from product and engineering when creating definitions. The glossary is most valuable when all teams agree to the terms. Share a draft, gather feedback, and revise until you have consensus.

Maintain the glossary as a living document. When confusion arises about a term's meaning, update the definition to clarify. When your process changes, update the affected terms. A glossary that reflects reality is more valuable than one that documents how things used to work.

## Structure and organization

Organize your glossary alphabetically for easy reference. Each entry should stand alone—readers should be able to understand a term without reading other entries first.

Use cross-references sparingly. If a term definition relies heavily on understanding another term, consider whether you have defined the terms at the right level of granularity. Either combine them or restructure the definitions to be more independent.

Keep definitions brief but complete. Aim for 1-3 sentences that capture the essential meaning, timing, and ownership. If you find yourself writing lengthy explanations, consider whether the concept belongs in a process guide rather than a glossary.
