# Team API overview document

The team API overview document is the central reference that defines how other teams work with your docs team. It serves as both a contract and a guide, establishing clear expectations for collaboration, processes, deliverables, and timelines.

## Purpose and audience

The overview document answers fundamental questions that stakeholders have when working with your docs team:

- How do I request documentation support?
- What does the docs team deliver?
- How long will documentation take?
- What channels should I use for different types of requests?
- What happens when things don't go according to plan?

This document is designed for:

- Product managers initiating feature launches
- Engineers implementing customer-facing changes
- Project managers coordinating cross-functional work
- Anyone who needs to understand how to engage with the docs team

## Core components

An effective team API overview document includes these essential components:

### Communication channels

Define the communication infrastructure that supports collaboration with your team. Specify which channels to use for different purposes, ensuring requests reach the right people through the right medium.

Include:

- Channel names and purposes
- When to use each channel
- Escalation paths for urgent situations
- Meeting structures for cross-functional coordination

This section prevents confusion about where to ask questions and ensures urgent matters get appropriate visibility.

### Request processes

Document the step-by-step process for requesting documentation support. This section transforms ambiguous expectations into concrete actions that stakeholders can follow.

Cover:

- When documentation is required (scope criteria)
- How to initiate a documentation request
- What information must be provided
- Minimum requirements for assignment
- Decision-making authority and review processes

Clear request processes reduce friction, prevent incomplete requests, and ensure the docs team receives the information needed to provide effective support.

### Deliverables

Specify exactly what the docs team provides for different types of requests. This section manages expectations and demonstrates the value the team delivers.

Include:

- Documentation outputs (plans, reviews, publications)
- Supporting activities (complexity assessment, collaboration)
- Quality standards
- Format and delivery methods

Explicitly listing deliverables helps stakeholders understand what they'll receive and what they won't, preventing scope creep and misaligned expectations.

### Timelines and complexity

Establish how long documentation work takes and what factors influence those timelines. This section provides planning predictability for stakeholders coordinating multiple work streams.

Address:

- Complexity assessment framework
- Lead time requirements for different complexity levels
- Factors that affect timelines
- How timelines are communicated and adjusted

Transparent timeline guidance enables realistic project planning and prevents last-minute surprises.

### Exception handling

Define what happens when the standard process can't be followed. Exceptions are inevitable, so document how they're handled before they occur.

Cover:

- Late-stage changes and their implications
- Urgent request procedures
- Consequences of not meeting requirements
- Override processes for extreme circumstances
- Escalation contacts

Exception handling sections demonstrate that you've thought through edge cases and provide clear paths forward when things go wrong.

### Cross-functional integration

Explain how documentation work fits into broader product development processes. This section helps stakeholders understand dependencies and coordination points.

Include:

- References to related processes (RACI matrices, launch frameworks)
- Integration points with other teams
- Shared responsibilities
- How documentation fits into the overall product lifecycle

## Creating your own overview document

When developing your team API overview document:

1. **Start with your request process**: Document how teams currently request documentation support, or design the process you want them to follow.

2. **Define your deliverables clearly**: Be specific about what you provide. Ambiguous promises create conflicts.

3. **Establish realistic timelines**: Base timeline estimates on historical data or complexity frameworks. Overpromising damages trust.

4. **Design communication channels intentionally**: Match channel types to the kinds of interactions your team has. Consider volume, urgency, and audience.

5. **Plan for exceptions before they happen**: Think through common failure modes and document responses in advance.

6. **Make it actionable**: Every section should tell readers what to do, not just describe abstract concepts.

7. **Keep it updated**: Review and revise the document as your processes evolve. An outdated team API creates confusion and erodes trust.

## Benefits of a team API overview

A well-designed team API overview document:

- **Reduces repetitive questions**: Stakeholders find answers independently instead of interrupting the team
- **Prevents process failures**: Clear requirements mean fewer incomplete or late requests
- **Manages expectations**: Explicit deliverables and timelines prevent disappointment
- **Enables scaling**: New team members and stakeholders can onboard themselves
- **Documents decisions**: Having exception processes in writing prevents ad-hoc, inconsistent responses
- **Demonstrates professionalism**: A comprehensive team API shows that your team operates systematically

## Customization considerations

Different docs teams will need different overview documents based on:

- **Team size**: Smaller teams may have simpler processes; larger teams need more structure
- **Product complexity**: More complex products often require more detailed complexity assessments
- **Development cadence**: Fast-moving teams may need shorter timelines; regulated industries may need longer review periods
- **Organizational structure**: How your team integrates with product, engineering, and other functions affects communication channels and request flows
- **Tool ecosystem**: Your issue tracking, project management, and documentation tools shape your processes

Adapt the framework to your specific context rather than copying generic examples verbatim.

## Common variations

Teams often customize their overview documents to address specific needs:

- **Multiple request types**: Some teams distinguish between new feature documentation, maintenance updates, and incident documentation, each with different processes
- **Tiered service levels**: Teams may offer different service levels (standard, expedited, emergency) with different requirements and timelines
- **Specialization by domain**: Teams with specialized writers may document assignment criteria based on product area or content type
- **Capacity planning sections**: Some teams include guidance on quarterly planning and capacity reservation
- **Quality gates**: Teams may define specific quality criteria that must be met before publication

## Maintaining your overview document

The overview document is a living artifact that requires ongoing maintenance:

- **Review quarterly**: Check that processes still reflect reality
- **Update after process changes**: Revise the document whenever you change how the team works
- **Gather feedback**: Ask stakeholders if the document answers their questions
- **Version control**: Track changes so stakeholders know when significant updates occur
- **Announce updates**: Communicate changes to the document through your established channels
