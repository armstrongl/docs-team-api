# What's a team API?

A team API is a documented agreement about how teams work together. It's similar to a traditional API (application programming interface) in that it specifies the input, outputs, and interactions between distinct interfaces (in this case, _teams_ are the interfaces). It answers four questions:

1. What information do you need to give us for us to help you?
2. What will you get back from us?
3. How long will it take?
4. What happens if something goes wrong?

When these answers are written down and shared, everyone knows what to expect. There's no guessing about what to include in a request, no uncertainty about timelines, and no surprises when priorities conflict.

## What problem it solves

From your perspective as a product manager or engineering manager, the problem isn't that the docs team is uncooperative—it's that the rules of engagement are unclear. You've probably experienced some of these frustrations:

- You submitted a documentation request but didn't know what information to include, so it bounced back for clarification.
- You weren't sure when to loop in the docs team, so you either involved them too early (wasting their time) or too late (creating a scramble).
- You needed documentation for a launch but didn't know how far in advance to plan or what the docs team needed from you.
- A launch timeline shifted and you weren't sure how that affected documentation or who to notify.

These problems happen because the interface is undefined. A team API solves them by making the rules explicit.

## What it means for you

A team API creates mutual commitments. The docs team commits to defined response times, clear requirements, and predictable processes. In exchange, you commit to providing complete information, reasonable timelines, and timely communication when things change.

Specifically, a team API means:

- You'll know exactly what information to provide when requesting documentation support.
- You'll know how far in advance to plan and what timelines are realistic.
- You'll know who's responsible for what at each stage of a release.
- You'll know what happens when priorities conflict or timelines shift.
- You'll get consistent treatment regardless of which docs team member handles your request.

## What it doesn't mean

A team API is not bureaucracy for its own sake. It doesn't mean:

- Every request goes through a formal approval process. Simple requests stay simple.
- Flexibility disappears. The API defines the standard path, but exceptions are handled through defined escalation processes.
- The docs team becomes less collaborative. The goal is clearer collaboration, not less of it.
- You need to memorize a complicated system. The API is documented and referenced—you don't need to keep it in your head.

The goal is to make working with the docs team predictable and friction-free, not to add overhead.

## Principles behind team APIs

Team APIs rest on four core principles that shape how teams collaborate effectively:

### Explicit over implicit

Written agreements beat tribal knowledge every time. When the rules of engagement exist only in people's heads, they're inconsistent, incomplete, and inaccessible to new team members. Explicit documentation ensures everyone has access to the same information, regardless of tenure or personal relationships.

### Mutual accountability

A team API isn't a one-way service-level agreement. Both sides have obligations. The docs team commits to response times and quality standards. Requesting teams commit to providing complete information and reasonable timelines. This mutual accountability creates a partnership rather than a customer-service relationship.

### Predictability enables autonomy

When teams know exactly what to expect from each other, they can work with less coordination overhead. Clear contracts mean you don't need to schedule a meeting to ask, "Is this enough lead time?" or "What information do you need?" You can plan your work independently, confident that you understand the interface.

### Error handling is part of the interface

Things go wrong. Timelines shift. Requirements change. Emergencies happen. A complete team API doesn't just define the happy path—it defines what happens when circumstances deviate from the plan. This includes escalation processes, conflict resolution, and how to handle urgent requests.

## Origins and related concepts

The concept of a team API comes from _Team Topologies_ by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais. They introduced the idea that teams should treat their collaboration patterns with the same rigor that engineers apply to technical APIs. Instead of ad hoc communication and undefined handoffs, teams benefit from explicit interfaces.

This framework extends that idea in two ways:

First, it applies the concept specifically to docs teams and their cross-functional partners. The generic team API concept becomes concrete through defined request templates, capacity planning models, and escalation paths.

Second, it borrows from service-level objective (SLO) thinking common in site reliability engineering. Just as SLOs make system reliability measurable and actionable, team APIs make collaboration patterns measurable and improvable. You can track whether the interface is working and identify where it needs adjustment.

The result is API design principles applied to human collaboration: clear inputs and outputs, documented behaviors, versioning, and error handling.

## The value exchange

A team API works because both sides get something valuable in exchange for their commitments.

### What the docs team commits to

The docs team makes specific, measurable commitments:

- **Response times**: Initial acknowledgment within one business day, full response within the timeframe appropriate to the request type.
- **Quality standards**: Documentation that meets defined quality criteria, reviewed by technical writers with subject matter expertise.
- **Predictable processes**: Consistent workflows so you know what to expect at each stage.
- **Capacity visibility**: Clear communication about current load and availability so you can plan accordingly.
- **Defined scope**: Explicit boundaries around what types of work the team handles, so you're never left wondering if something is in scope.

### What other teams commit to

In exchange, requesting teams make their own commitments:

- **Complete information**: All required context provided upfront using defined templates or checklists.
- **Reasonable timelines**: Documentation requests submitted with adequate lead time based on documented guidelines.
- **Timely communication**: Prompt notification when requirements change, launches shift, or new information becomes available.
- **Participation**: Engagement in review cycles, technical validation, and feedback loops within defined timeframes.
- **Respect for scope**: Understanding what the docs team does and doesn't handle, and routing requests appropriately.

### Why both sides benefit

This exchange creates mutual value:

- **For product and engineering teams**: You get predictability, which enables better planning. You know what you'll get, when you'll get it, and what you need to provide. This reduces last-minute scrambles and rework.

- **For the docs team**: Standardized inputs reduce context-switching overhead. Complete information upfront eliminates rounds of clarification. Reasonable timelines allow for higher-quality work and better capacity planning.

- **For both**: Explicit agreements reduce friction, build trust, and create accountability. When something goes wrong, the team API provides a framework for diagnosis and correction rather than finger-pointing.

The value exchange transforms the relationship from transactional ("we need documentation") to collaborative ("we're building something together with defined roles").
