# Glossary template

Use this template to create a shared glossary of terms for your team. A shared glossary establishes consistent terminology across documentation, product, and engineering teams, preventing miscommunication during feature launches and cross-functional collaboration.

**How to use this template:**

- Replace example terms with your team's actual terminology
- Keep definitions concise (1-3 sentences) but complete
- Include timing, ownership, and context in each definition
- Organize terms alphabetically for easy reference
- Update the glossary when confusion arises or processes change
- Review the [glossary documentation](../docs/glossary.md) for detailed guidance on creating effective definitions
- See [sample glossary](../examples/sample-glossary.md) for a complete example

## Core terms

Define the terms your team uses most frequently in cross-functional collaboration. Focus on words that have ambiguous meanings or vary across teams. Each term should specify what it means, when it applies, who is responsible, and how it relates to your process.

**Code complete:** Code complete occurs when feature code is merged and deployed (possibly behind a feature flag). Bugs can be fixed after this point, but major functionality is complete. Changes after code complete should not affect documentation scope.

**Documentation plan:** A section in the project document for a launch. It must meet the documentation plan requirements defined by the docs team's process.

**Launch:** A feature is launched when announced to users. This typically involves publishing documentation, a changelog, and marketing communications.

**Project document:** The collaborative source of truth for information about a project (typically a feature launch). It contains sections for different teams to complete. Use a template to maintain consistency without making it cumbersome for stakeholders.

**Release:** A feature is released when code is complete. The functionality might be hidden behind a feature flag until launch. Code is considered live when deployed to production.

## Formatting your entries

Each glossary entry should follow this structure:

**Term name:** Definition that includes what the term means, when it applies, who owns or is responsible for it, and what happens next in your process. Keep definitions focused on your organization's specific usage rather than universal definitions.

Use bold formatting for the term name, followed by a colon, then the definition. Write definitions in present tense using active voice. Avoid cross-referencing other glossary terms unless absolutely necessary—each entry should stand alone.

## Organization-specific variations (Optional)

If your organization type (SaaS, enterprise software, developer tools, platform) uses terminology differently from standard usage, document those variations here. This section helps teams understand how general terms apply in your specific context.

### Your organization type

- Describe how common terms are adapted in your organization
- Note differences between your usage and industry-standard definitions
- Explain why these variations exist if the reasoning is not obvious

## Maintaining your glossary

Keep your glossary current by following these practices:

- **Update when confusion occurs:** If a term causes miscommunication in a meeting or planning session, clarify the definition immediately after
- **Revise when processes change:** When your team adopts new workflows, stages, or artifacts, update affected terms to reflect current reality
- **Review during onboarding:** When new team members join, use their questions to identify missing or unclear terms
- **Version control your glossary:** Track changes so teams can see how terminology evolves over time
- **Share with stakeholders:** Ensure product, engineering, and marketing teams have access and know to reference it

A glossary is most valuable when it accurately reflects how your team currently works, not how things used to work or how you wish they worked.
