# Minimum requirements template

Use this template to define your team's baseline requirements for accepting documentation work. This document establishes a clear contract between your docs team and stakeholders: meet these requirements, and documentation support is guaranteed; fail to meet them, and support cannot be assured.

**How to use this template:**

- Replace example text with your team's specific requirements and policies
- Adjust the checklist to match your team's actual needs
- Modify required fields to align with your work tracking system
- Update consequences and accountability sections to reflect your team's workflow
- For detailed guidance on defining minimum requirements, refer to the [minimum requirements](../docs/minimum-requirements.md) documentation
- For a complete example, see [sample minimum requirements](../examples/sample-minimum-requirements.md)

## Requirements checklist

Before the docs team can assign resources to your project, the project must meet all of the following requirements.

Replace this list with your team's actual requirements. Each item should be binary (met or not met) and verifiable without subjective judgment.

- The project must have an estimated feature-complete date.
- The project must have a target release date.
- The parent initiative must have a linked documentation request.
- The documentation request must have all required fields completed.
  - See the "Documentation request required fields" section below.
- A subject matter expert must be identified and available for questions.

If a project does not meet these requirements, documentation support cannot be guaranteed. See the "When requirements are not met" section below.

## Documentation request required fields

For the docs team to accept a request, the documentation request must be linked to the parent initiative and must include all required fields.

Customize this table to match the fields in your work tracking system. Include fields that writers need to begin work effectively. Avoid fields that are "nice to have" but not essential.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Request type` | The type of documentation needed (new feature, update, deprecation, API reference). |
| `Target audience` | The primary readers (end users, developers, administrators, partners). |
| `Scope estimate` | Estimated documentation scope (small: < 2 pages, medium: 2-5 pages, large: > 5 pages). |
| `Subject matter expert` | The primary contact for technical questions. |
| `Review contacts` | People who must review and approve the documentation before publication. |
| `Target date` | When the documentation must be ready. |
| `Related materials` | Links to specs, designs, or existing documentation to update. |

## When requirements are not met

Projects that do not meet minimum requirements may experience one or more of the following outcomes:

Adapt this list to match the actual consequences your team applies. Be specific and realistic - only include consequences you will consistently enforce.

- Documentation work is deprioritized or delayed.
- No dedicated writer is assigned to the project.
- Documentation ships after the feature launch.
- The requesting team must provide draft documentation for the docs team to edit.

To avoid these outcomes, ensure your project meets all requirements before submitting a documentation request.

## Accountability

The project lead or product manager is responsible for ensuring a project meets these requirements before requesting documentation support. The docs team reviews incoming requests and follows up on incomplete submissions, but cannot guarantee support for projects that do not meet requirements.

Update this section to specify who is accountable on both sides: who must ensure requirements are met (typically project leads or product managers) and who validates completeness (typically docs team leads or intake coordinators).
