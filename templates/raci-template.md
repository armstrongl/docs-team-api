# RACI template

Use this template to create your own RACI matrix. Customize the activities and roles to match your organization's structure.

## Key

This section defines the four RACI designations that clarify responsibility and accountability for each activity in your workflow.

- **R (Responsible):** Does the work.
- **A (Accountable):** Ultimately answerable for completion; approves the work. There must be exactly one A per activity.
- **C (Consulted):** Provides input before or during the work.
- **I (Informed):** Kept updated on progress or outcomes.

## Roles

Define your roles here. Specify each role with a clear description of their function and area of responsibility within the organization.

- **Role 1:** Description
- **Role 2:** Description
- **Role 3:** Description
- **Role 4:** Description

## Phase 1: Phase name

This phase represents a distinct stage in your workflow or project lifecycle. Replace "Phase name" with your actual phase name (e.g., Planning, Development, Deployment).

| Activity | R | A | C | I |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Activity description | Role | Role | Role | Role |
| Activity description | Role | Role | Role | Role |
| Activity description | Role | Role | Role | Role |

## Phase 2: Phase name

Use additional phase sections as needed to cover all stages of your workflow. Each phase should represent a logically distinct set of activities.

| Activity | R | A | C | I |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Activity description | Role | Role | Role | Role |
| Activity description | Role | Role | Role | Role |

## Tips for creating your RACI

1. **Start with activities, not roles.** List everything that needs to happen, then assign responsibilities.
2. **Every activity needs exactly one A.** If nobody is accountable, the work won't get done. If multiple people are accountable, nobody is.
3. **Minimize C and I.** Too many people consulted or informed creates noise and slows decisions.
4. **R and A can be the same person.** For simple activities, the person doing the work is also accountable.
5. **Review with stakeholders.** The value of a RACI comes from the discussion, not just the document.
