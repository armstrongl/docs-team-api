# Sample minimum requirements for documentation support

This example demonstrates how a docs team might define minimum requirements for project intake. Adapt the checklist, required fields, and accountability model to fit your team's workflow.

## Requirements checklist

Before the docs team can assign resources to your project, the project must meet all of the following requirements.

- The project must have an estimated feature-complete date.
- The project must have a target release date.
- The parent initiative must have a linked documentation request.
- The documentation request must have all required fields completed.
  - See the "Documentation request required fields" section below.
- A subject matter expert must be identified and available for questions.

If a project does not meet these requirements, documentation support cannot be guaranteed. See the "When requirements are not met" section below.

## Documentation request required fields

For the docs team to accept a request, the documentation request must be linked to the parent initiative and must include all required fields.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Request type` | The type of documentation needed (new feature, update, deprecation, API reference). |
| `Target audience` | The primary readers (end users, developers, administrators, partners). |
| `Scope estimate` | Estimated documentation scope (small: < 2 pages, medium: 2-5 pages, large: > 5 pages). |
| `Subject matter expert` | The primary contact for technical questions. |
| `Review contacts` | People who must review and approve the documentation before publication. |
| `Target date` | When the documentation must be ready. |
| `Related materials` | Links to specs, designs, or existing documentation to update. |

## When requirements are not met

Projects that do not meet minimum requirements may experience one or more of the following outcomes:

- Documentation work is deprioritized or delayed.
- No dedicated writer is assigned to the project.
- Documentation ships after the feature launch.
- The requesting team must provide draft documentation for the docs team to edit.

To avoid these outcomes, ensure your project meets all requirements before submitting a documentation request.

## Accountability

The project lead or product manager is responsible for ensuring a project meets these requirements before requesting documentation support. The docs team reviews incoming requests and follows up on incomplete submissions, but cannot guarantee support for projects that do not meet requirements.
